# Vet-Clinic
It is intended that with this mobile application, there is an interaction between the clinical staff of the Veterinary Clinic and the owners of the animal hospitalized. This way the customer can access what changes exist in the clinical picture of their animal without the need to move or call the site. The application aims to combat the lack of information often felt by animal owners. In this application, data such as the animal's general condition, medication administered, treatments, changes in the food situation, need for supervision care, etc., is also recorded. It also allows a chat for the placement of questions/doubts. The application is implemented using React Native using FireBase as a "backend as a service".
